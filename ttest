In Julia, an ordinary `struct` is copied to a new object by assignment, and the resulting object cannot be changed:

julia> struct S x::Int end
julia> a = S(3)
S(3)
julia> b = a
S(3)
julia> b.x = 5
ERROR: setfield: immutable struct of type 5 cannot be changed
julia> a
S(3)

But, also in Julia, a `mutable struct` is not copied, but with assignment instead a new _reference_ to the original struct is created.
The undelying mutable struct's data will be changed in value for both variables if changed by either variable's reference:

julia> mutable struct Sm x::Int end
julia> a = Sm(3)
Sm(3)
julia> b = a
Sm(3)
julia> b.x = 5
5
julia> a
Sm(5)

This can be important with passing a struct to a function. Such a function might change that struct's contents as seen by the 
calling code, if the struct is mutable. In Julia, functions that change the contents of an array or struct that is passed to them
are by convention to be named with an exclamation point, as in

function doublearray!(array)
    array .*= 2
end
