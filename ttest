{{draft task}}

A toothpick of length L and thickness and width T units is randomly spun and dropped on a grid which has parallel
lines of negligible width, spaced W <= L units apart. The toothpick will come to rest on one of its long faces on the grid.

Using Monte Carlo methods, calculate the proportion of drops where the toothpick crosses one of the parallel lines, with the 
following numbers:

Toothpick Length     Width/Thickness   Line Spacing
----------------------------------------------------
       20                 1                 20
       40                 5                 20
       40                 1                 80
       
You may assume for the purposes of the simulation that if the toothpick just touches a line that it does not cross that line.








The [[wp:Chi-squared_distribution|Chi-squared]]  (Ï‡2) distribution is a frequently used distribution in statistics. 
The <em>chi-squared</em> distribution can be calculated from the gamma function as follows:


;The task:
# Take a uniform random number generator and create a large (you decide how large) set of numbers that follow a 
Chi-squared distribution for values 1 through 10 of the <em>k</em> variable.  Calculate the dataset's mean and 
standard deviation, and show a histogram of the data. Mention any native language support for the generation of 
the gamma function.

; Stretch task:
# Plot the Chi-squared distribution for several values of k.
