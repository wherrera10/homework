The [[wp:Chi-squared_distribution|Chi-squared]]  (Ï‡2) distribution is a frequently used distribution in statistics. 
The <em>chi-squared</em> distribution can be calculated from the gamma function as follows:


;The task:
# Take a uniform random number generator and create a large (you decide how large) set of numbers that follow a 
Chi-squared distribution for values 1 through 10 of the <em>k</em> variable.  Calculate the dataset's mean and 
standard deviation, and show a histogram of the data. Mention any native language support for the generation of 
the gamma function.
