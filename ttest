A positive integer n is said to be a Rhonda number to base b if the product of the base b digits of n is equal to b times the sum of n's prime factors.

These numbers were named by Kevin Brown after an acquaintance of his whose residence number was 25662, a member of the base 10 numbers with this property.


25662 is a Rhonda number to base-10. The prime factorization is 2 × 3 × 7 × 13 × 47; the product of its base-10 digits is equal to the base times the sum of its prime factors:

2 × 5 × 6 × 6 × 2 = 720 = 10 × (2 + 3 + 7 + 13 + 47)

Rhonda numbers only exist in bases that are not a prime.

Rhonda numbers to base 10 always contain at least 1 digit 5 and always contain at least 1 even digit.


Task
For the non-prime bases b from 2 through 16 , find and display here, on this page, at least the first 10 Rhonda numbers to base b. Display the found numbers at least in base 10.
