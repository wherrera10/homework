For example for 1942-01-01, how to find all values (amounts) that occur in this day (from time 0 to 24) and then sum them together?

    time, amount
    1942-01-01T00:00:00,     7.0
    1942-01-02T00:00:00,     0.2
    1942-01-03T00:00:00,     2.1
    1942-01-04T00:00:00,     3.0
    2012-12-31T23:00:00,     4.0
    2012-12-31T24:00:00,     0.0
    
transform!(df, day => x -> round(x, Day))
combine
