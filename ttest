Try (if you want double precision, ie 64 bit floats):

    dparse(s) = parse(Float64, replace(s, 'd' => 'e'))

as BallpontBen said in comments. For BigFloat, replace 'Float64' with BigFloat above. If you get errors from your data parsing, consider

    dparse(s) = something(tryparse(Float64, replace(s, 'd' => 's')), missing)

which will give you missing for parse errors instead of throwing an error.
